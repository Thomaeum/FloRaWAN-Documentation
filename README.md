# FloRaWAN-Documentation

The FloRaWAN project aims to create an IOT solution for smart tree monitoring. Using LoRaWAN with the Things Network, custom sensor nodes, and process management, the state of the flora is intended to be documented, analyzed, and acted on.
So far, we have set up a LoRaWAN gateway.
Currently, we are developing sensor nodes and integrate those into the Things Network.

This repository includes documentation and details concerning the FloRaWAN project.
