# FloRaWAN-Documentation

The FloRaWAN project aims to create an IOT solution for smart tree monitoring. Using LoRaWAN with the Things Network, custom sensor nodes, and process management, the state of the (urban) flora is intended to be monitored, documented, analyzed, and acted on.
Thus, taking care of plants more effectively and reducing the damage caused by hot summers, for instance.
